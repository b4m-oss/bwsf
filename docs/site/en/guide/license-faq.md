# License FAQ

## Q: Is `bwsf` free to use?

Yes, `bwsf` is released under the `MIT License` and can be used by anyone for free.

## Q: Who is responsible if damage occurs from using `bwsf`?

Since `bwsf` is released under the `MIT License`, the developers cannot take any responsibility.

For details, please see the [MIT License text](./license.md).

Therefore, we recommend explicitly clarifying responsibility among stakeholders other than the developers in case of damage.

## Q: Can I incorporate `bwsf` into our company's product?

Yes, you can. It can be incorporated within the scope of the [MIT License](./license.md).

The responsibility allocation in case of damage is the same as the question above.

## Q: If I incorporate `bwsf` into our company's product, do I need to disclose the source code?

No, you don't. The [MIT License](./license.md) does not mandate such action.

Some other open-source licenses have such requirements, but the MIT License does not mandate it.

## Q: I want to add features to `bwsf`

No problem. Feel free to fork from GitHub and develop.

If you send the added features as a pull request, we may incorporate the added features as new features in `bwsf`.

## Q: I want features added to `bwsf`, but I can't do it myself

`bwsf` is an open-source project.

First, please post a new feature request on [our GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/b4m-oss/bwsf/discussions/categories/ideas).

The development team will consider whether to add the new feature.

If the decision is made to add a new feature, there is no guarantee of when that new feature will be implemented.

## Q: Can I pay for development to have a new feature added?

We do accommodate such feature additions, but it depends on whether your request and our terms align.

Please contact us first through the [Bicycle for Mind contact form](https://b4m.co.jp/contact).

## Q: I want to donate to `bwsf`
