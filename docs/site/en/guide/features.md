# Key Features

`bwsf` is a helper command for securely managing .env files using [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/).

## Saving .env Files

```bash
# cd /path/to/your/project_root
bwsf push
```

This command saves all .env files in your project root to Bitwarden at once.

- .env
- .env.local
- .env.staging
- .env.production

These files are uploaded to Bitwarden together.

Note that configuration files containing `.example` in their name, such as `.env.local.example`, are NOT saved to Bitwarden.

## Applying .env Files to Your Project

```bash
# cd /path/to/your/project_root
bwsf pull
```

This pulls the .env files for the current project stored in Bitwarden and saves them to your project root.

## Multi-User Sharing via Bitwarden

On the Bitwarden side, files are saved in a folder called `dotenvs`. (This is a reserved word.)

When you run `bwsf` in your project root, the name of that root folder becomes the project name.

By sharing the `dotenvs` folder with other users on Bitwarden, you can share .env files among multiple team members.

For more details, please refer to the [Bitwarden documentation](https://bitwarden.com/resources/).
